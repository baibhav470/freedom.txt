Hi, my name is Michael Van Veen and I own this website. I no longer wish to
stay Anonymous in the fight against internet censorship and those who want to
close down our internet.

An open internet is more important than the interests of nation states.
Governments have failed us because of ignorance & corruption. They must be
fought.

An open internet is more important than corporations. They have failed us
because of their natural greed. They must be changed.

An open internet is more important than security, copyright infringement,
terrorism or child pornography. We will not be fooled by the strategies of
fear employed by those who wish to censor us.

A closed internet is a tool of oppression. An open internet is a weapon of
mass creation. Pick your sides. Create your own freedom.txt on your websites.
