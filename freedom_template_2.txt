Hi, my name is {name} and I own this website.

I no longer wish to stay anonymous in the fight against Internet
censorship and those who want to close down our Internet.

An open Internet is more important than the interests of nation
states.

An open Internet is more important than corporations.

An open Internet is more important than security, copyright
infringement, terrorism or child pornography.

Many governments have failed us because of ignorance and corruption;
they must be fought. Many corporations have failed us because of
their greed; they must be changed.

The interests of a few are not more important than the freedoms of
all, whether those interests are seeded in greed, control, religion,
or the false promises of security.

We will not be fooled by the strategies of fear employed by those
who wish to censor us.

A closed internet is a tool of oppression. An open internet is a
weapon of mass creation. Pick your sides. Create your own freedom.txt
on your websites. Use this freedom.txt as a template, if you'd like,
or head to freedomtxt.org for more information.

Thank you for reading.
