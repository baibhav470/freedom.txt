### Generate Your Own

Running `freedom.py` from the command line will generate a fresh `freedom.txt` 
file after a little prompting.

Add your new link to locations.txt as a seperate line in order to have the script 
automattically add it.

The following will add a custom `freedom.txt` into the local directory:

    $ python freedom.py 
    What is your name? Michael Van Veen
    Hi, my name is Michael Van Veen and I own this website.
    
    I no longer wish to stay anonymous in the fight against Internet
    censorship and those who want to close down our Internet.
    
    An open Internet is more important than the interests of nation
    states.
    
    An open Internet is more important than corporations.
    
    An open Internet is more important than security, copyright
    infringement, terrorism or child pornography.
    
    Many governments have failed us because of ignorance and corruption;
    they must be fought. Many corporations have failed us because of
    their greed; they must be changed.
    
    The interests of a few are not more important than the freedoms of
    all, whether those interests are seeded in greed, control, religion,
    or the false promises of security.
    
    We will not be fooled by the strategies of fear employed by those
    who wish to censor us.
    
    A closed internet is a tool of oppression. An open internet is a
    weapon of mass creation. Pick your sides. Create your own freedom.txt
    on your websites. Use this freedom.txt as a template, if you'd like,
    or head to freedomtxt.org for more information.
    
    Thank you for reading.

### /etc/hosts Integration

**experimental**: *Now supports `/etc/hosts` integration!*

Running with the `--with-hosts` flag will add in your `/etc/hosts` file.

    hosts_file:
      broadcasthost:
        - 255.255.255.255
      localhost:
        - 127.0.0.1
        - ::1
        - fe80::1%lo0

The `--hosts-file` switchoff will let you specify a custom hosts location to read from.

Finally, `--write-hosts` will write a `HOSTS` file in your local directory.

    $python freedom.py --hosts-file=/etc/hosts --write-hosts

*default output ensues...*

    writing file [HOSTS]... OK

    $ freedom.txt git:(etc_hosts) âœ— cat HOSTS

### Adding links

For now, send me a pull request with your link and I'll include it.
