freedom.txt
===========

### Introduction

Publicly announce your support against internet censorship!  

Join the dozens who have already pledged their support.

### Links 

* [My freedom.txt](http://www.mvanveen.net/freedom.txt).
* [Project website](http://wastedcode.com/freedom/).
* [Inderpreet's  original blog post][isingh] for more information

### Generate Your Own

Running `freedom.py` from the command line will generate a fresh `freedom.txt` 
file after a little prompting.

Add your new link to locations.txt as a seperate line in order to have the script 
automattically add it.

The following will add a custom `freedom.txt` into the local directory:

     $ python freedom.py 
     What is your name? Michael Van Veen
     Where should I write file to [freedom.txt]? 

### Adding links

For now, send me a pull request with your link and I'll include it.

I plan to add a command line arg to add links automattically in the near future.
